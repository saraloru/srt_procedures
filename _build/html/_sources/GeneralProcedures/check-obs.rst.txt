#. Check that the data are correctly written in your project section :

    ``$ cd /archive/data/[projectID]/``   


#. Look at the Quick-look of the data :

    ``$ idl``             

    ``IDL> .r fitslook``

    ``IDL> fitslook``
	
Note that the subscans are shown with a short delay in the quick-look
plots with respect to the real observations.

#. **jlog**

     The logging display shows warning and error messages. Warning
     messages are indicated in yellow while error messages are in red
     |logo| :numref:`srt_jlog`.

     Check the possible error messages. Try to understand the origin
     of the problem and to solve it. In case of persistent/complex
     problem, contact and report the error messages and the associated
     UT to the responsible of the observation. 


#. **Meteo client**

     Check the wind speed on the Meteo client. If it exceeds 60 km/h,
     the antenna must be stowed |logo| :numref:`srt_windspeed`. 

  
On nuraghe-obs1

#. **Scheduler**

     Check the status of the Scheduler is ok (green).
     During the tracking, @ is green while it is red during the
     slewing of the antenna. |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`

     Check the update of the number of scan/subscan according to your
     schedule (.scd). Scans will be skipped if the target is not
     visible at the moment of the observations.

     If you realize that the scan/subscan number is frozen or that the
     tracking is red while the antenna is tracking the source, stop
     the on-going schedule with:

     ``> antennaStop``    (in the operatorInput)

     then start again the schedule:

     ``> antennaStart=[projectID]/â€¦scd,n``    (with n the number of scan)


#. **MinorServo**

     Check the status and the tracking are green |logo| :numref:`srt_minorservo`.


#. **ReceiverBoss**

     Check the status is OK (green). If the derotator (dewar) is used,
     check the configuration and status (ready green). |logo|
     :numref:`srt_receivers`


#. **AntennaBoss**

     Check the status is OK (green). |logo| :numref:`srt_antennaboss`
		

#. **Mount**

     The status are green while the antenna is pointing a source. |logo| :numref:`srt_mount`


#. **Active surface**

     Check that the state of the active surface corresponds to your
     choice (shaped, shaped fixed, parabolic, parabolic fixed). |logo|
     :numref:`srt_activesurface`

     "Ok" should be green during the observations. 

     Sometimes, not all of the small squares of the active surface are
     green. Do not worry for that. Instead, it can be problematic if a
     large fraction of the active surface becomes red.



Primary Control Panel ACU
---------------------

Check that everything appears in green. If a red box appears, put the cursor
on it and look at the error message.


Contact and report the error messages to the responsible of the observation (observer friend).
