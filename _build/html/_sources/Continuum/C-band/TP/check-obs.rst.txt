Check during the observations
==============================

$ : commands to insert in a shell   
 
> : commands to insert in the operatorInput panel


#. On nuraghe-obs2, check that the data are correctly written in your project section :

    ``$ cd/archive/data/[projectID]/``   


#. Look at the Quick-look of the data :

    ``$ idl``             

    ``IDL> .r fitslook``

    ``IDL> fitslook``
	
    Note that the subscans are shown with a short delay in the
    quick-look plots with respect to the real observations.


#. Antenna monitors

	Check that everything section is green. If a red box appears, put the cursor on 	it and look at the error message.

	Contact and report the error messages to the responsible of the observation 		(observer friend?).

#. Panels

        * Scheduler : status OK, green

	During the tracking, @ is green while it is red during the slewing of the antenna.

	Check the update of the number of scan/subscan according to your schedule. Scans will be skipped if the target is not visible at the 		moment of the observations.

	If you realize that the scan/subscan number is frozen or that the tracking @ is red while the antenna is tracking the source, stop the 		on-going schedule with 

	``> antennaStop``    (in the operatorInput)

	then start again the schedule:

	``> antennaStart=[projectID]/…scd,n``     (with n the number of scan)

 	* AntennaBoss : status OK, green.

 	* Mount : READY, READY, OK green (CHECK!!!!) while the antenna is pointing a source.

 	* MinorServo; tracking @ is green, the status ids OK and green.

 	* Receivers : status OK, green.

	If the derotator (dewar) is used, check the configuration and status (ready green).

#. Active surface

 	Sometimes, not all of the small squares of the active surface are green. Do not worry for that. Instead, it can be problematic if a 		large fraction of the active surface becomes red.


	* Check that the state of the active surface corresponds to your choice (shaped, shaped fixed, parabolic, parabolic fixed).


 	* “Ok” should be green during the observations.

#. Log

 	* The log file (jlog) contains warning and error messages. Warning messages are indicated in yellow while error messages are in red.

 
 	* Check the possible error messages. Try to understand the origin of the problem and to solve it. In case of persistent/complex problem, contact and report the error messages and the associated UT to the responsible of the observation (observer friend?).

#. Weather parameters

 	 On nuraghe-obs1, activate the meteo client:

	``$ meteoClient``

        If the wind speed exceeds 61 km/h, the antenna must be stowed.
