   contain the root `toctree` directive.

#. Insert your project number :

    ``> project=[projectID]`` |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler` 

#. Initial setup :

    ``> antennaReset``

    ``> setupKKG``  |logo| :numref:`srt_receivers`


#. Select the active surface shape (Shaped configuration for K-band
 observations) :

    ``> asSetup=S`` |logo| :numref:`srt_activesurface`

#. Insert the Local Oscillator value in MHz :

    ``> setLO=[freq]``  |logo| :numref:`srt_receivers`

#. Select the Total Power backend :

    ``> chooseBackend=BACKENDS/TotalPower`` |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`

#. For each section [sect], insert the bandwidth ([bw]=300, 730, 1250 or 2000 MHz) and the sample rate (in MHz) :

    ``> setSection=[sect],*,[bw],*,*,[sampleRate],*`` |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend`

    Reminder : in K-band there are 7 feeds, so 14 sections with
    ``[sect]`` = 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.


#. If you want to use the multi-feed derotator to prevent field rotation during long acquisition, select the derotator configuration :

    ``> derotatorSetConfiguration=[config]``   with ``[config]`` = BSC, CUSTOM or FIXED. |logo| :numref:`srt_receivers`

        - BSC is for Best Coverage Space (automatic rotation of the
          dewar in order to best cover the scanned area).

        - CUSTOM : the user has to choose the angle of the dewar axis
          with the y-axis of the scanning frame that will be kept
          during the whole duration of the acquisition :
          ``>  derotatorSetPosition=[ang]d``     with ``[ang]`` the
          dewar angle in degrees.

        - FIXED : the dewar keeps a fixed postion w.r.t the horizon,
          no rotation is applied. To specify a static angle :
          ``>  derotatorSetPosition=[ang]d``     with ``[ang]`` the
          dewar angle in degrees.


    To read back the position of the dewar :

    ``> derotatorGetPosition``  |logo| :numref:`srt_receivers`


#. Put the antenna at 45 deg of elevation and attenuate the signal for
 the 14 sections [sect] in order to obtain values between 750 and 1100
 counts (linear range of the backend) :

     ``> goTo=*,45d``   |logo| :numref:`srt_mount`

     ``> getTpi``

     ``> setAttenuation=[sect],[att]``	with [att] between 0 and 15 dB |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend`

     ``> getTpi``


#. Check the tsys (typical values) :

    ``> tsys`` |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend`

#. Begin the schedule by indicating the start scan [N] or subscan [N_n] in the SCD file :

    ``> startSchedule=[projectID]/[schedulename].scd,[N]`` |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`
